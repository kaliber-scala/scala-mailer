*Job opening: Scala programmer at Rhinofly*
-------------------------------------------
Each new project we start is being developed in Scala. Therefore, we are in need of a [Scala programmer](http://rhinofly.nl/vacature-scala.html) who loves to write beautiful code. No more legacy projects or maintenance of old systems of which the original programmer is already six feet under. What we need is new, fresh code for awesome projects.

Are you the Scala programmer we are looking for? Take a look at the [job description](http://rhinofly.nl/vacature-scala.html) (in Dutch) and give the Scala puzzle a try! Send us your solution and you will be invited for a job interview.
